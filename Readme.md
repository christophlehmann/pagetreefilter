TYPO3 Extension: Pagetree Filter
================================

It adds a wizard like the new content element wizard that helps finding content elements and records in the page tree. With a few clicks you know where they are used. You can also see what elements are not used.

## Example filters

Highlight pages with...

* sys_category records: `table=sys_category`
* image content elements: `table=tt_content CType=image`
* hidden image content elements: `table=tt_content CType=image hidden=1`
* content elements where the elements header starts with rocket: `table=tt_content header=rocket*`
* content elements where the elements header ends with launch: `table=tt_content header=*launch`
* content elements where the elements header contains rocketlaunch: `table=tt_content header=*rocketlaunch*`


## Installation

`composer require christophlehmann/pagetreefilter`

## Configuration

### Enable for non admin users (User TSconfig)

`tx_pagetreefilter.enable = 1`

### PageId

The wizard needs a page id for fetching Page TSconfig in order to gather possible content elements and plugins. This page id is determined by

1. First WebMount in case the user is no admin
2. Extension configuration: `pageId` (default: `1`)

### ~~ignoreFields (Page TSconfig)~~

~~The wizard creates a filter based on~~ `tt_content_defValues`~~, see~~ `mod.wizards.newContentElement.wizardItems`.
~~If you don't like them, then you can ignore them:~~ `tx_pagetreefilter.buildFilter.ignoreFields = tx_gridelements_columns`

The settings is removed in v1.4.0. For now only `CType` and `list_type` are used to filter for content elements and to determine if they are used. Feel free to create an issue if you really need it.
